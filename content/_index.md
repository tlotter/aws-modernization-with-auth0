In this Workshop, you will learn how to secure Consumer, B2B and SaaS applications with Auth0 by Okta.

Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users.

The goal of the workshop is to build an end-to-end demo environment from creating a free Auth0 Tenant and AWS account, adding Auth0 to a web application, customizing the login form, and enabling business-to-business authentication.

## Auth0 and AWS Marketplace
Auth0 is available on the AWS Marketplace. AWS Marketplace is a digital software catalog that makes it easy to find, try, buy, deploy, and manage the software that runs on AWS. AWS Marketplace has a broad and deep selection of ISV solutions that can help you to get your ideal Identity solution in the cloud.
